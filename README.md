Diabetes Prediction App
A web-based application built with Streamlit for predicting diabetes using a dataset from Kaggle. This app allows users to input various health metrics such as Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level and Blood Glucose level to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: Diabetes Prediction Dataset. It contains various health metrics and indicators that are used for predicting diabetes.

Feature Descriptions:
HbA1c Level: Hemoglobin A1c level is a measure of a person's average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months. Higher levels indicate poor blood sugar control and increased risk of diabetes.

Blood Glucose Level: Blood glucose level refers to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream at a given time. High blood glucose levels are a key indicator of diabetes.
